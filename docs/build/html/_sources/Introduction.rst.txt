Introduction
===================

CRISPR-BETS (CRISPR-Base Editing To Stop codon) is developed for designing gRNA to knockout gene by CRISPR base editing system. 
CRISPR-BETS has both online and desktop version, which are integrated into a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) and compatible with major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Guide RNAs can be designed easily without any environment installation. Users can complete the analysis with a simple mouse click. Results will display with detailed information and fancy images, which are able to be downloaded. Moreover, CRISPR-BETS allows instant check the gRNA specificity.
